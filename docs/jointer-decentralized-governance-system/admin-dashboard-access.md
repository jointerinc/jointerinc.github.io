In order to provide the community tools to analyze and vote, Jointer created access to transparent, accurate, and relevant information for holders of JNTR, JNTR/ETN, and JNTR/STOCK. By holding any amount of JNTR, JNTR/ETN, or JNTR/STOCK, holders are given access to a dashboard that displays every aspect of the protocol, the current rules, and the majority level needed to change the rules. To access the admin dashboard users need to sign with their wallet and be identified through two-step verification.

### Steps to access the dashboard and vote

1. Integrate a wallet that holds any amount of JNTR, JNTR/ETN, or JNTR/STOCK
2. Complete two-factor authentication with a six (6) digit code from SMS/email
3. View the current rules (as is) vs the proposed rule (how it will be after) and choose your vote YEA or NAY
