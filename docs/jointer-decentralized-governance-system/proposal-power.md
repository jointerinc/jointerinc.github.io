Individual users gain proposal rights by holding a large amount of the total JNTR circulated supply.

### How proposal power is determined

1. Users with voting power that is equal to 1% or more of the total JNTR circulated supply will have proposal power to change a rule within the system.

### Dual voting

Users that hold JNTR will have voting power and may have proposal power over rules that affect the JNTR holders community. If a rule also affects the JNTR/ETN or JNTR/STOCK holders community, it will require dual or triple voting from the JNTR holders community and from JNTR/ETN and/or JNTR/STOCK holders community as well in order to pass (similar to how govremanates runs dual voting via two houses upper and lower).
