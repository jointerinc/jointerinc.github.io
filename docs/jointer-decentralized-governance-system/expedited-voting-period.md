# Expedited Voting Period

Users with proposal power [^46] equal to 10% or above have the power to expedite the voting period
to 24 hours from the proposal opening instead of waiting until the recurring monthly vote.

[^46]: You can crowdsource this expedited voting process but it must be decided ahead of time
