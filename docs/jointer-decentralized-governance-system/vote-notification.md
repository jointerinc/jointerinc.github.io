# Vote Notification

Informing users of upcoming votes is crucial to participation in Jointer's decentralized governance system. In order to make sure the community is informed, an email and SMS with a link to the admin dashboard will be sent 14 days before the vote closes and again 24 hours before the voting period closes. Voting for a rule proposal opens and displays 24/7 on the admin from the moment a successful rule proposal is submitted.
