# Crowdsource Proposals - suggest a change

- Users without proposal power can crowdsource their proposal amongst other users until the total group collectively reaches the threshold for suggesting a change through a rule proposal (at least 1% or more of the total JNTR circulated supply).
- Once the crowdsource proposal reaches the threshold proposal power, the proposal will be submitted to the community like any other proposal.
- Unsuccessful crowdsource proposals will be closed automatically 24 hours after closing vote time, 12:00 am UTC on the first day of each month.
