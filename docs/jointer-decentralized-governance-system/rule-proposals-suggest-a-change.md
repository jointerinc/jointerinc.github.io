# Rule Proposals - suggest a change

After successfully gaining access to the dashboard, user's with proposal power may propose a
change to the rules. The process is simple, requiring users to make a change directly on the
admin dashboard and click save.

- All proposals are open to the community the moment they are submitted, until the close of the vote.[^44]
- All proposals have the same closing vote time, 12:00 am UTC on the first day of each month.
- All proposals must be proposed no later than 24 hours before the closing vote.[^45]
- Users that suggest a change may also withdraw the proposal and cancel the voting process at any time before voting ends.

[^44]: Be careful waiting until the last moment to vote because the protocol runs on Ethereum blockchain and is subject to gas times which could delay your vote from reaching the proposal contract in time.
[^45]: Proposals outside of this window will stay pending until the following month begins.
