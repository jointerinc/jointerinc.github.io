# JNTR Vote Revelations

The number of wallets will be revealed throughout the process but the amount of votes for YEA or NAY will stay anonymous until the end of the voting period to remove propaganda or manipulation potential.

## Duplicate proposals

If proposals for the same rule are submitted more than once with different changes (ie. a proposal to change max investment from 150% to 160% and another proposal to change max investment from 150% to 170%) the order to accept the changes (assuming that both passed) is based on the earliest timestamp of the proposal. Meaning the first proposal submitted will be executed first but the later proposal will determine the final change.
