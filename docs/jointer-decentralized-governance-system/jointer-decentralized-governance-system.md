# Jointer Decentralized Governance System

Since inception, Jointer’s goal has been to achieve a fully decentralized syndication economy based around a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). In order to achieve this goal, Jointer needs to delegate control in a manner that organizes Jointer and the community for a sustainable and decentralized future.

The Jointer Decentralized Governance System (DGS) is broken up into two parts, governance rights and level of quorum calculations. When combined, Jointer community members are able to propose and execute rules based on the category of decision being proposed compared to the level of majority required to execute the proposal. For example, changing the max alloted of investment per day requires only a low level majority (Simple Majority) compared to the high level majority (Double Absolute Majority) which would be required to change the protocol majority implementation.

The DGS highlights how the future of JNTR is controlled by the Jointer community while protecting the protocol fairness and sustainability.

User’s governance rights are placed into one or two categories: Voting power and Proposal Power.
