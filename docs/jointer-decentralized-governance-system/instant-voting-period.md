# Instant Voting Period

If a proposal receives YEA or NAY by an absolute majority (50%+1 of the voting power versus the total CIVP of the entire JNTR circulating supply), the proposal executes or is rejected instantly without delay. The instant voting period instantaneously finalizes[^47] the vote once submitted.

[^47]: This can take place ahead of time but also executes instantly during the voting period
