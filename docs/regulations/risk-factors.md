# Risk Factors

- As with any digital/cryptocurrency, purchasing Jointer assets involves a high degree of risk.
Those who cannot risk losing their entire purchase should not buy these assets.

- The ability to transfer the coins is subject to a secondary market for digital securities functioning. If there is no secondary market in which to sell the coins, investors could be left holding them in perpetuity.

- The assets have no voting rights or ability to direct the company or its actions.

- Government changes to the current regulations or tax code changes could impact our results. It is also possible that regulators from the jurisdictions in which a purchaser of Jointer assets reside may, after the purchase of the coins, conduct investigations and take regulatory action. Additionally, it could become prohibited for the secondary market to sell or purchase Jointer assets.

- Residents of certain jurisdictions may not be permitted to purchase cryptocurrencies or digital assets. In some cases, even participating in a purchase may be illegal in certain jurisdictions. New or revised legislation, regulations, guidelines, and directives may be introduced, which may affect the Jointer marketplace or other platforms in which the Jointer token is used.

- There is always the possibility that our burn rate will increase to support changes and operating costs, so we may run out of capital before reaching the next significant milestone. This could change our plans and force us to earmark more funds to fill the gaps.

- When deciding whether or not to purchase Jointer assets, you must rely on your own examination of the issuer and the terms of the offering, including the merits and risks involved. The Jointer assets have not been recommended or approved by any federal or state securities commission or regulatory authority. Furthermore, these authorities have not passed upon any information regarding the accuracy or adequacy of this document.

- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not decide on the merits of any securities offered or the terms of the offering. Nor does it make a decision on the accuracy or completeness of any offering document or literature.

- Jointer assets are offered under an exemption from registration; however, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has not made an independent determination that these securities are exempt from registration.
