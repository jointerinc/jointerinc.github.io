# Initial Qualifications

Since Jointer will begin fundraising under US Regulation D 506(c) and Regulation S, the investor
pool is limited. Therefore, certain qualifications must be met and the regulatory process must be
followed in order to participate.

Prior to submitting a bid in the Jointer Auction, the investor must be qualified by meeting the following conditions:

- All investors will complete onboarding procedures established by Jointer or Jointer’s partners, including AML/KYC review.

- Each investor will complete the verification process to confirm they are outside of the US or other regulated countries and complaint with Regulation S, or are accredited investors under Regulation D of the Securities Act.

- If investors use ETH, they are able to participate directly from their wallet of choice once approved. At the moment, Jointer’s Auction page supports MetaMask but other wallet
support will be added down the road.

- For Bitcoin, Fiat backed stablecoins, and other cryptocurrency, Investors will need to swap their funds using Element Zero SmartSwap or any other solution. After the auction launch-es, Jointer plans to integrate SmartSwap into the auction which allows users to invest BTC and other cryptocurrencies. The SmartSwap processes the swap and refunds fees and gas in a native token.

- Investors with fiat money that want to use conventional bank wiring will need to transfer the desired amount of funds they wish to invest into a designated escrow account, established by the escrow agents engaged by Jointer. More information about this process will be shared by Jointer after the auction launches. Investors that invest through exchanges, will invest funds using their exchange wallet, the exchange will distribute the JNTR assets
directly.
