Jointer’s offering complies with

1. Section 201(a), the SEC adopted paragraph (c) of Rule 506. Under Rule 506(c), based on this rule issuers can offer securities through means of general solicitation, provided that: All purchasers in the offering are accredited investors; the issuer takes reasonable steps to
verify their accredited investor status and that certain other conditions in Regulation D are satisfied.

2. Reg S allows non-US investors to invest in a US company or a non-US company on a similar
basis to the Reg D terms, but with **no requirement** to be accredited investors.

## Non-Accredited Investors

In regulated countries such as the US, there are three options for non-accredited investors to buy Jointer assets:

1. Purchase them from an accredited investor via a security exchange in the secondary market. In this situation, accredited investors are subject to rule 144 to hold their securities for 12 months before they can sell them to non-accredited investors.

2. If a company completes registration of its public offering of securities, and those securities are registered with the SEC and the 50 states, anyone will be able to buy and sell the registered securities.

3. If a company can prove that their security is no longer a security based on the “Howey Test” created by the US Supreme Court for determining whether certain transactions qualify as "investment contracts."

Note: Non-accredited investors from non-regulated countries can freely purchase JNTR if they pass KYC/AML. To check if your country has regulations, consult with your local legal representative.
