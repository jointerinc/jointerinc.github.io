Recognizing the importance of liquidity for investors led Jointer to develop Jointer's Liquid Economy. The goal of the Liquid Economy is to provide trust and liquidity options to all of Jointer’s investors. To accomplish the goal, Jointer’s Liquid Economy is composed of the Liquidity Reserves’ Protocol and leverages the Law of Scarcity.
