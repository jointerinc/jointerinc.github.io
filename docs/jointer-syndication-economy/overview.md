Jointer's digital assets are managed on a distributed ledger, the Ethereum blockchain, with full transparency and 24/7 access.

Jointer's Syndication Economy focuses on short and long term value for investors. The decision to create an inclusive Syndication Economy fits within Jointer's mission to make Commercial Real Estate available to everyone. In accomplishing this, Jointer presents three asset classes that aim to fit the needs of every investor:

|![etn](/assets/images/etn.jpg) | **JNTR/ETN** is akin to an Exchange-traded Note (ETN) that is pegged with 2X leverage on the Dow Jones Global Select REIT Index, aiming to provide ~20% returns per year |
|![stock](/assets/images/stock.jpg)|**JNTR/STOCK** is preferred shares in Jointer, gaining value as the company grows and the Net Asset Value (NAV) increases.|
