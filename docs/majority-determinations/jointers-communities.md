# Jointer's communities

Jointer's syndication economy includes three communities (JNTR, JNTR/ETN, JNTR/STOCK)
which rely on each other to function at full efficiency. Each rule proposal has the opportunity to
impact community members of one community or all three of the communities. Therefore,
when a rule proposal impacts a community of a different asset within Jointer's syndication
economy, that community will get a voice in the final outcome of the vote.

Jointer proposals will receive a single, double, or triple classification which will determine if
multiple communities will participate in voting for the outcome of a rule proposal.
