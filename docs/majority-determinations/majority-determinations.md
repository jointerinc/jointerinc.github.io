# Majority Determinations

The majority is determined out of the total actual participants. Total actual participants is the user’s cumulative individual voting power comparative to the total voting power present for voting on a rule
proposal.

**Example**

- A rule is proposed and requires a YEA action by a Simple
Majority (50%+1 of the total actual participants)

- 100 users participate by voting “YEA” or “NAY” on the proposed rule. Each user has 1,000 unlocked/unstaked JNTR representing1% of the voting power which combined, equals 100,000 total qualified votes

- This means for the proposed rule to pass, 50,001 or more of the qualified votes must be cast as YEA and anything below this amount will fail
