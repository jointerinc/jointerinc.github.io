| **Instant Funding** <br> Once Jointer's due diligence is complete and the property is cleared for investment, Jointer can issue the owner a check for their equity within 24 hours. | ![benefit_for_owners_1](/assets/images/benefit_for_owners_1.jpg) |
| **End-to-End Solution** <br> First, by removing the need for syndication, all other complex issues and high costs associated with the process are removed. Further, Jointer's funding process does not change the owner's traditional closing process and will take place using regular title companies and fiat currency such as the US Dollar. | ![benefit_for_owners_2](/assets/images/benefit_for_owners_2.jpg) |
| **Skin in the Game** <br> The industry standard for sponsor contribution is 10% of the down payment (considered “skin in the game”). Jointer positively alters the industry standard so in cases of purchasing a new property or re-capping an existing property, Jointer will purchase and require the sponsor to pay only 5% of the down payment. | ![benefit_for_owners_3](/assets/images/benefit_for_owners_3.jpg) |
| **Sponsors' Promote (also know as a carry)** <br> The industry standard for a sponsor's carry is to receive on average 25% of the properties profits, usually after investors (LP) receive preferred returns (5%-12%). Jointer offers sponsors better terms with a 50% carry after the preferred returns. On average, using Jointer over traditional syndication will net sponsors 400% increased ROI. | ![benefit_for_owners_4](/assets/images/benefit_for_owners_4.jpg) |

**How does Jointer support giving owner's 50% ownership when they only contribute a 1%[^15] down payment of the property's value?**

Jointer stays a passive investor in the property to avoid ongoing management. Therefore, Jointer splits the ongoing cash flow with the owner while the property appreciation follows the amount invested in the property. The act of Jointer earning less per property will attract top properties and owners looking for re-cap opportunities to utilize Jointer similar to how Amazon took less profits to encourage a larger scale.

[^15]: 5% of the down payment
