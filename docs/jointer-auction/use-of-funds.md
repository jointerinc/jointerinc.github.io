The proceeds from investments received from selling JNTR during the Jointer Auction or from other channels set up a robust ecosystem benefiting Jointer investors. Jointer puts 100% of the proceeds to work through Commercial Real Estate investments and the Liquidity Reserves.

### Evergreen fund

Unlike traditional companies that execute distributions and dividends to founders and shareholders, Jointer reinvests 100% of all the profits from real estate investments into new real estate projects to support Jointer's success.
