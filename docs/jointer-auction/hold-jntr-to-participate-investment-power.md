# Hold JNTR to Participate "Investment Power"

Investment power is limited to the amount of JNTR held in the investor's wallet. In order to participate in the auction, investors will need to hold JNTR in their wallet which can be obtained through secondary trading. Investors can invest in Jointer's Auction up to 100% (1:1 face value) of their unlocked JNTR holdings at the time of the investment.

**Example**

N.B. On Jointer Auction days one through five (1-5), this requirement is waived.
