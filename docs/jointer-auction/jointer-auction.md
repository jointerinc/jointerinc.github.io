# Jointer Auction

Jointer is a decentralized open-ended fund syndicating investment through daily auctions which in turn is invested wholly in Commercial Real Estate and the Liquidity Reserves. The Auction provides investors JNTR with dynamic rewards to encourage investors to invest the maximum daily amount.

Each auction day, investors have the opportunity to invest as much or as little as they desire to receive their pro-rata JNTR supply while still benefiting from the purchasing power of the whole group.

Every auction runs daily opening at 12:00 PM GMT and ending at 11:00 AM GMT. The one hour pause is for potential system maintenance and distribution.
