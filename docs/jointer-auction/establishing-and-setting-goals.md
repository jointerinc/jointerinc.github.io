# Establishing and Setting Goals

The goal of each Auction day is based on the total amount of funds raised the day before. The daily amount raised becomes the following day's goal. This process repeats itself daily, always setting the goal based on the previous day's fundraising amount at the conclusion of the auction.

The goal on Auction Day One is set by Jointer because it cannot be set by yesterday's contributions. After day one, daily goals are set by the market, not Jointer. At the end of each auction the total supply is distributed to the investors that participated, regardless of the results. Therefore, even if the total starting supply is worth  10,000 and the investor or group of investors invest only $0.01, they still will receive the entire supply.

On day one of the Auction, Jointer is setting the starting mint at 50,000 JNTR.

NB. Each Auction day's starting mint is calculated based on yesterday's results. This amount increases when the contributions exceed yesterday's investment results.
