# Jointer's Solution for Commercial Real Estate Investors

The Jointer Syndication approach levels the playing field in the Commercial Real Estate industry by offering investors, from all walks of life, the opportunity to participate in the commercial market without the barriers or risks associated with the current tokenization models and traditional solutions, mentioned above.

Jointer presents investors unlimited diversification while improving their returns and minimizing their risk through a Syndication Economy which is powered by three (3) different and distinct asset classes, JNTR, JNTR/ETN, and JNTR/STOCK.

Jointer's diversification removes the exposure and risk associated with investing in a single property. Investment distributions and returns are managed by a smart contract, which ensures full transparency and a trustless process. Income and investment streams serve as cross-collateral and the performance is based on fully-disclosed public information.
